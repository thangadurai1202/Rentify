# Rentify
Rentify is a web app that streamlines property rentals for owners and tenants. Built with Java Spring Boot and React, it lets users register as sellers to post rentals or as buyers to search for properties based on preferences. Rentify facilitates communication between sellers and buyers, making it easier to find the perfect rental property.
